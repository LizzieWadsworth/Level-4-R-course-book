# Dataframes

We've looked at single values, and multiple values in a list. The next step is to look at tables of data - we can do this with **dataframe**. You'll commonly see this named as `df` for `d`ata`f`rame.

```{webr}
# Create a data frame
Data_Frame <- data.frame (
  Training = c("Strength", "Stamina", "Other"),
  Pulse = c(100, 150, 120),
  Duration = c(60, 30, 45)
)

# Print the data frame
Data_Frame
```

If you look in your environment (top right panel) you'll now see your `Data_Frame` variable. If you click it, this will open it in a new tab next to your R script.

We can use the built-in function `summary()` to create an overview of our data. For our numerical columns, this provides us with the **interquartile range**.

### Summarise the data

```{webr}
summary(Data_Frame) # Create a summary of our data
```

This is already all the information we need to create a box plot!
