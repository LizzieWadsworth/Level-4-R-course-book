# Chi-squared test

As our grand total of observed values is more than 50 and every observation exceeds 5, we can use the chi squared test.

```{webr}
#| context: interactive
#| autorun: true
# Calculate the chi squared test 
chisq <- chisq.test(activities_by_sex)

# Print a table of observations
chisq$observed

# Print a table of expected values
chisq$expected

# Print the p-value
chisq$p.value
```

As the p-value is 0.0597, it is **not** less than 0.05 and therefore not significant with less than a 5% chance of error.
