# Pearson's coefficient: using cor.test()

Our second example uses `cor.test()`. This gives us the R value - how strong is the correlation?

```{webr}
#| context: interactive
#| autorun: true
correlation_stats <- cor.test(heart_df$age, heart_df$restbp, method = 'pearson')

correlation_stats$p.value
correlation_stats$estimate
```

As you can see that works very similarly to our first example, except for the last two lines.

`cor.test()` gives us a list of 9 values, there are only two we are interested in:

-   `p.value` is our probability p value
-   `estimate` is our correlation coefficient (R value, same as above)
