#  Violin plots

Violin plots are similar to box plots, but they show more information on what the *distribution* is. A violin plot can sometimes give more useful information than a box plot.

To change from a box plot to a violin plot, you only need to change from `geom_boxplot()` to `geom_violin()`.

```{webr}
# Import the CSV file into an R Dataframe
locust_df <- read.csv("LocustSerotonin.csv") 
head(locust_df)

# Plot the data using ggplot package
ggplot(locust_df, aes(x = treatmentTime, 
                      y = serotoninLevel, 
                      group = treatmentTime, 
                      fill = treatmentTime)) +

  geom_violin() 
```

*Question:* If you add the line `+ geom_point()`, what happens?
