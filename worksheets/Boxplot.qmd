# Boxplot

We're going to use a library of functions called `ggplot2` to make our box plot.

Before we can use the library, we need to install it. To do that, copy the following line into the *console* (bottom left section): `install.packages('ggplot2')`

```{webr}
# Libraries
library(ggplot2) # load ggplot2 libray 

# Create a boxplot of pulse
ggplot(Data_Frame, aes(y = Pulse)) +
  geom_boxplot() 
```

Do the values match what we got in the `summary()` function?

Let's break that down:

-   `ggplot(Data_Frame, aes(y = Pulse)) +`
    -   `ggplot()` : This is our plotting function
    -   `Data_Frame`: This is our argument of what data we want to use
    -   `aes()`: aes is aesthetics, which allows us to choose our groups for x, y or categories
    -   `y = Pulse`: this is setting our y value to be the pulse column
-   `geom_boxplot()`
    -   This tells R to use the data we chose to make a boxplot
