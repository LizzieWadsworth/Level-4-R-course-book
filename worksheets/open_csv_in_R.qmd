# Open CSV file in R

Once you've moved the `LocustSerotonin.csv` to your R programming folder, you can then open this in your R file. We can do this using functions: 

1.  Use the function `read.csv()` to import our data into R as a `d`ata`f`rame. This will appear in the environment (top right panel) with our variables.

2.  Use the function `head()` to view the first five rows of our table.

```{r}
#| eval: false
locust_df <- read.csv("LocustSerotonin.csv") 
head(locust_df)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
locust_df <- read.csv("../Datasets/LocustSerotonin.csv") 
head(locust_df)
```

We can also view our `d`ata`f`rame by clicking the variable `locust_df` in the environment tab (top right panel).
