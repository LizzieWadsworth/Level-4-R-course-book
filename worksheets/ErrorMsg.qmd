# Error messages

Programming code is it's own language, but with *really strict grammar*. If I mistakes make in sentrances, like I do in this one, you can still understand the meaning.

If we make a mistake in code, even a typo, the computer **will not understand**.

However, it does *try* to be helpful. We get an `Error message` in the console (bottom left panel) that gives us a clue as to what the problem is.

Try with the below code. What does the error message say? Can you try and fix it?

```{webr}
# This is an example of an error message - what is the problem in the code?

pinapple <- "Pineapple smoothie" 
pineapple
```
