# Task 1: Read the data

To start off, you will want to:

1.  Read the csv file into R as a dataframe
2.  Use `summary` to get an overview of the data
3.  Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the numerical columns

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Hint 1"}
For reading a csv file as a dataframe, check the [Open CSV file in R](open_csv_in_R.qmd) page. 

For using `summary` to summarise the data, check the [Dataframes](CreateDataframe.qmd) page.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Hint 2"}
For calculating the mean and standard deviation, check the [R functions](RFunctions.qmd) page.

To get the numerical column from your dataframe, use `$`: 

`dataframe_name$column_name`

Which you can use as an input to the mean and standard deviation functions
