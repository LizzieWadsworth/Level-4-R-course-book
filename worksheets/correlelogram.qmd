# Correlelograms

Our dataset contained more than just age and blood pressure - it would be useful to see if there are any correlations between e.g. blood pressure and maximum heart rate, or cholesterol and age.

We can also use R to do an all-against-all correlation analysis, so without doing all of the above we can get an idea of if there are any correlations.

This uses the corrplot library. You might need to run `install.packages('corrplot')` before you can run this code.

```{webr}
#| context: interactive
#| autorun: true
library(corrplot)
heart_df_only_numerical <- heart_df[,-2] # creates a new dataframe which doesn't include the "sex" column. 
heart_corrplot_matrix <- cor(heart_df_only_numerical) # calculates all-against-all correlation matrix
corrplot(heart_corrplot_matrix) # makes a correlelogram based on the calculations
```

Let's break that down:

-   `library(corrplot)` is loading the corrplot package, which has the functions we need

-   `heart_df_only_numerical <- heart_df[,-2]`

    -   Our sex in this dataframe is categorical (M or F) so we need to remove it

    -   `heart_df[,-2]` is selecting the whole of the `heart_df` dataframe *except column 2*

-   `heart_corrplot_matrix <- cor(heart_df_only_numerical)`

    -   This uses the `cor()` function to calculate all-against-all correlations

-   `corrplot(heart_corrplot_matrix`

    -   This takes our all-against-all correlations and plots a correlelogram

`Corrplot` also has different settings you can use.

To plot the strength of the correlation (R value) numerically, try: `corrplot(heart_corrplot_matrix, method = "number")`

And if you only want to show the correlations that are statistically significant with a 5% chance of error:

`corrplot(heart_corrplot_matrix, sig.level = 0.05)`
