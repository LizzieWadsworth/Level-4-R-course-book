# Extension task

Correlation doesn't always equal causation - and [Spurious correlations](https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations) has many examples to prove this.

If you go to the website and click on a correlation, you should get a table with the raw data.

You can then: 1. Copy and paste this table into excel 2. Save your excel spreadsheet as a CSV file 3. Read the CSV in R 4. Plot and test the correlations

It may not be as straightforward as you'd think to copy the data from the table and get this into R.

You might find that R doesn't like spaces in column or row titles - or that your columns and rows are the wrong way around.
