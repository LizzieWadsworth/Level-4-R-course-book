# Extension task

Correlation doesn't always equal causation even with a very low p-value - and [Spurious correlations](https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations) has many examples to prove this.

If you go to the website and click on a correlation, you should get a table with the raw data.

You can then: 
  
1. Copy and paste this table into excel 
2. Save your excel spreadsheet as a CSV file 
  \
(File -> Save As -> File format "Comma Separated File (.csv)") 
3. Move this file into your R programming folder
4. Read the CSV in R 
5. Plot and test the correlations

::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}
It may not be as straightforward as you'd think to copy the data from the table and get this into R.

You might find that R doesn't like spaces in column or row titles - or that your columns and rows are the wrong way around.

::: {.callout-warning collapse="false"}
A CSV file can't save any Excel formatting such as font colour. It also can't have more than one sheet - anything on a second sheet will disappear!
