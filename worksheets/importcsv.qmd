# Download CSV file 

We have a file of data from an experiment on locusts. Download the file below, and **move this to the same folder you have your R code**. 

A csv file is like a plain excel table, but missing all the Microsoft formatting. This makes it easier for us to use.

```{=html}
<a href="../Datasets/LocustSerotonin.csv" 
   class="btn btn-lg text-white rounded-pill px-4 py-2" 
   style="background: linear-gradient(90deg, #13a4b4ff, #143c53ff); box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);"

The dataset we are going to use is `LocustSerotonin.csv`. This contains serotonin levels in the central nervous system of desert locusts that were experimentally crowded for 0 (the control group), 1, and 2 hours. 

This data is from Chapter 2 of [The Analysis of Biological Data](https://whitlockschluter3e.zoology.ubc.ca/RExamples/Rcode_Chapter_2.html).

This is a Dataset with 3 columns of data: 

| Column | Data |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| serotoninLevel | Measurement of serotonin in individual locusts |
| treatmentTime | Amount of time being crowded (0, 1 or 2 hours) |
| serotoninCategory | Rank of serotonin level in three categories (High, Medium, Low) |
