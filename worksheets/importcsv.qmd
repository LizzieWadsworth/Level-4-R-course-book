# Import CSV from Excel 

Next we're going to use tabular data from excel and import that as our data.

I've put a `csv` file on the Canvas page for you to download and copy into your folder. A csv file is like a plain excel table, but missing all the Microsoft formatting. This makes it easier for us to use.

You can turn any excel file into a csv file by going `File -> Save as -> File format: csv`.

::: callout-warning
A CSV file can **only have one sheet**. If you have an excel file with multiple sheets and save it as a csv, the rest of the sheets will be lost!
:::

The dataset we are going to use is `LocustSerotonin.csv` which you can find on the Canvas page. This contains serotonin levels in the central nervous system of desert locusts that were experimentally crowded for 0 (the control group), 1, and 2 hours. This data is from Chapter 2 of [The Analysis of Biological Data](https://whitlockschluter3e.zoology.ubc.ca/RExamples/Rcode_Chapter_2.html).

```{webr}
locust_df <- read.csv("LocustSerotonin.csv") 
head(locust_df)
```

1.  We are using the function `read.csv()` to import our data into R. This will appear in the environment (top right panel) with our variables.
2.  We are using the function `head()` to view the first five rows of our table.

As you can see we have a dataset of three columns:

| Column | Data |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| serotoninLevel | Measurement of serotonin in individual locusts |
| treatmentTime | Amount of time being crowded (0, 1 or 2 hours) |
| serotoninCategory | Rank of serotonin level in three categories (High, Medium, Low) |
