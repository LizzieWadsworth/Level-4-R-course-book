# Odds and Risk ratios

## Odds Ratio

We can calculate the odds ratio for our comparison using the `oddsratio()` function from the `epitools` package.

You'll first need to `install.packages('epitools')`.

```{webr}
#| context: interactive
#| autorun: true
library(epitools)
# Calculate the odds ratio 
odds_activities_by_sex <- oddsratio(activities_by_sex)
odds_activities_by_sex$measure
```

This result shows us the odds of male students doing an activity (compared to females) is 1.491 -\> they are around 1.5 times more likely to be doing an activity.

Also in this table are the "lower" and "upper" values are the boundaries for the 95% confidence interval. As both values are above one, this indicates increased odds (of males doing an activity compared to females).

We can do the same calculation the other way around, looking at the odds of females doing an activity compared to males.

```{webr}
#| context: interactive
#| autorun: true
# Calculate the odds ratio 
odds_activities_by_sex <- oddsratio(activities_by_sex, rev="rows")
odds_activities_by_sex$measure
```

The options you can give for the rev (reverse) parameter are "neither", "rows", "columns" and "both".

## Risk ratio

Risk ratio is very similar to odds ratio (refer back to Statistics Lecture 4 for an explanation of the differences).

We can also calculate risk ratio in R.

```{webr}
#| context: interactive
#| autorun: true
# Calculate the odds ratio 
risk_activities_by_sex <- riskratio(activities_by_sex)
risk_activities_by_sex$measure
```

This shows the risk of males doing an activity (compared to females) is 1.217.
