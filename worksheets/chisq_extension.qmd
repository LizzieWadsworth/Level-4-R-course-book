# Chi-Squared Extension

This was a very large dataset and we only looked at a few columns.

What else can you find out?

Not all of the columns are categorical data - if you want to compare any other two variables (e.g. whether they went to nursery and their current grades); which test would you use?

We've covered all the main statistical tests now, so try and apply what you've learnt from *every* tutorial to this database.

But remember - you're statistical test results are only ever as good as the data you've collected!
