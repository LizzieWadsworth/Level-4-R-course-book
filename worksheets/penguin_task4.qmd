# Task 4: Visualise distributions of FlipperLength and BodyMass

Next, use a histogram to visualise the distributions of sizes. You may want to use the `fill =` option to separate by one of the categories.

Make histograms of:

1.  FlipperLength, separated by species
2.  BodyMass, separated by species

::: {.callout-tip collapse="false" title="Example of generated graph"}
A histogram of of FlipperLength separated by species and Sex should look like this:

```{r}
#| echo: false
library(ggplot2)
penguin_df <- read.csv("../Datasets/penguins.csv") 
ggplot(penguin_df, aes(x = FlipperLength, fill = CommonName)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth=2.5)
```
:::

This is the end of the penguin task. Well done for getting this far! Just like a baby penguin learning how to swim and hunt for itself, learning how to program is a skill that takes time, practice and a lot of trial and error.
