# Pearson's coefficient: using cor()

We can use two R functions to calculate our R and p values using a Pearson's coefficient.

Our first example uses `cor()`. This gives us the R value - how strong is the correlation?

```{webr}
#| context: interactive
#| autorun: true
correlation_R_value <- cor(heart_df$age, heart_df$restbp, method = 'pearson')
correlation_R_value
```

Let's break that down:

-   `cor(heart_df$age, heart_df$restbp, method = 'pearson')`
    -   `cor()` : This is our *function* name. This is a built in function.
    -   `heart_df$age` : This is going to our dataframe called heart_df and extracting the column of values under the column name "age"
    -   `heart_df$restbp` : This is going to our dataframe called heart_df and extracting the column of values under the column name "restbp"
-   `method = 'pearson'`
    -   This is a **parameter**, which is an option to choose how we want the function to work.
    -   We can set this to either `'pearson'` or `'spearman'` depending on which test we want to use.
