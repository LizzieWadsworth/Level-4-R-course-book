# Fisher test

We can also do a fisher test if we're looking at categories with a smaller value.

If we compare sex and whether or not the student wants to go to higher education, you'll see we have very low numbers of students that *don't* want to go to higher education in this class.

```{webr}
#| context: interactive
#| autorun: true
# Calculate the chi squared test 
# find categories with value less than 5 
higher_by_sex <- table(maths_students$sex, maths_students$higher)
higher_by_sex
```

We can then use the fisher test:

```{webr}
#| context: interactive
#| autorun: true
# Calculate the chi squared test 
fish <- fisher.test(higher_by_sex)
fish
```
