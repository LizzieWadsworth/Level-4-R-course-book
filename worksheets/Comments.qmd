# Comments

If you put a hash `#` at the start of the line, this means it will be *igorned* and not run as code.

We use comments to add **notes** - to anyone else using our code, or to our future selves (you will forget what your code does!)

```{webr}
# This is a comment and will not be run as R code 

# Here is another example of variables, using a string (word or string of letters)
b <- "Banana smoothie"
b

# But this one will not run - can you tell why? 
# c <- "Pineapple smoothie" 
# c
```
