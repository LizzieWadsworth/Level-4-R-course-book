# Penguins dataset introduction

For this set of tasks, you will need the `penguins.csv` file. 

```{=html}
<a href="../Datasets/penguins.csv" 
   class="btn btn-lg text-white rounded-pill px-4 py-2" 
   style="background: linear-gradient(90deg, #13a4b4ff, #143c53ff); box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);"

This is data from a study which looked at penguin couples. Once a penguin pair had laid an egg, both parents were captured and measurements were taken. They were then tracked to see if they would go on to have a second egg or "Full Clutch".

This dataset contains the following information:

| Column        | Data                                            |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| SampleNumber  | Unique number for every penguin                 |
| LatinName     | Species name, full Latin name                   |
| CommonName    | Common name for the penguin species             |
| FullClutch    | Whether or not the penguin couple laid two eggs |
| FlipperLength | Length of the penguin's flipper in millimeters  |

To process this data using R, using the techniques you've covered so far, this has been split into 5 small tasks.
