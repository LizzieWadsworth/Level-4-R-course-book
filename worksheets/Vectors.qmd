# Vectors

After variables, the next thing we need to understand is vectors.\
Vectors are a bit like lists but they can only hold one *type* of variable such as all integers (whole numbers) or all strings (words in "quotes").

To make a vector, we need to use the `c()` function

::::: columns
::: column
```{webr}
my_numbers <- c(3, 7, 9, 12)
my_numbers
```
:::

::: column
```{webr}
my_animals <- c("Otter", "Parrot", "Ferret")
my_animals
```
:::
:::::

::: {.callout-note title="Question"}
What happens to the numbers in the `my_numbers` vector if you change `9` to `9.5`?
