You can do this on campus from a University Computer, online using a free Posit Cloud account that you can access from any web browser, or by downloading R and RStudio onto your own device.\nClick below to see the set up instructions for each:\n\nUniversity ComputerOnline CloudOwn Device\n\n\nTo get set up, follow the below steps. Click each step for detailed instructions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Launch RStudio from AppsAnywhere\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType in AppsAnywhere to the windows bar. This will open in a web browser\nType in RStudio in AppsAnywhere\nClick “Launch” and wait for it to install and open.\n\n\n\n\nGIF of Opening RStudio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Navigate to your OneDrive folder\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy and paste the following into the Console on the left, and press enter.\n\nsetwd(\"O:/\")\n\nClick the “More” cog and select “Go To Working Directory”\n\nYou should now be in your OneDrive. You should be able to recognise the files and folders listed, from what you have saved here in your other classes.\n\n\n\nGIF of Opening OneDrive\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you get the error message ‘cannot change working directory’\n\n\n\n\n\nOccasionally there is an issue with how OneDrive is loaded on the University computer.\nIf you get the error message:\nError in setwd(\"O:/\") : cannot change working directory\nThen try the following. Replace the underscores with your K number.\nsetwd(\"C:/Users/K______/\")\nClick the “More” cog and select “Go To Working Directory”\nThen find and click on the folder:\nOneDrive Kingston University\nClick the more cog and select Set As Working Directory\n\n\n\nGIF of Opening OneDrive with common error\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Create or move to a folder for LS4003\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you don’t already have a folder for LS4003 Statistics, then you can create one by clicking “New Folder” and entering a name.\nIf your new folder doesn’t appear, click the refresh button (to the right of the more cog).\nThen:\n\nClick into your new folder\nClick the More Cog and select “Set As Working Directory”\n\n\n\n\nGIF of Making a Folder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Create an R file\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you’re in your folder you can create and save an R file. This is where you put your code.\n\nClick on the Green Plus icon and select “R Script”\nIn the top bar, click “File” and then “Save”\nGive your file a name (e.g. “R_tutorial_1” )\n\nWhen you make any changes, you can save the file by going File -&gt; Save.\nYou can also save by holding down Control and S at the same time.\n\n\n\nGIF of Making an R File\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will automatically add the “.R” extension so we know it’s an R file - R_tutorial_1.R\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure you can find your file in file explorer. Always back up your work such as saving in OneDrive or emailing to yourself so that you don’t lose your progress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 5: Write and run R code\n\n\n\n\n\nYou’re now ready to run some R code!\n\nCopy and paste the following into your R file:\n\n\nvalue &lt;- \"Hello World\"\nvalue\n\n\nHighlight both lines and click the “Run” icon (green arrow)\n\nYou should see a result in your console (bottom left panel) and your environment (top right panel)\nYou’re now ready to start learning R!\n\n\n\nGIF of Running an R File\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosit Cloud is a free online browser version, allowing you to work from any device.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\n\n\nYou shouldn’t need a paid account for this course. If you use up the compute hours then I suggest downloading RStudio and R onto your own device.\n\n\n\nTo get set up, follow the instructions below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Launch RStudio from AppsAnywhere\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a free account and login\nCreate Project -&gt; RStudio\nName your project (where it says “Untitled Project”)\n\n\n\n\nGIF of Creating a PositCloud Project\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Create an R file\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you’re in your project you can create and save an R file. This is where you put your code.\n\nClick on the Green Plus icon and select “R Script”\nClick the Save icon\nGive your file a name (e.g. “My_R_file” )\n\nRemember to keep saving your file using the save icon.\n\n\n\nGIF of Making an R File\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will automatically add the “.R” extension so we know it’s an R file - My_R_file.R\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Write and run R code\n\n\n\n\n\nYou’re now ready to run some R code!\n\nCopy and paste the following into your R file:\n\n\nvalue &lt;- \"Hello World\"\nvalue\n\n\nSave your R file by clicking the save icon\nHighlight both lines and click the “Run” icon (green arrow)\n\nYou should see a result in your console (bottom left panel) and your environment (top right panel)\nYou’re now ready to start learning R!\n\n\n\nGIF of Running an R File\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re working on your own laptop or computer it’s also possible to download and run R and RStudio. These are both free, open-source programs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re working on a tablet, chromebook or your device is typically slow, I recommend looking at the Posit Online Cloud option instead\n\n\n\nInstalling R and RStudio can be a bit fiddley - let the teaching team know if you’d like any support.\nWhy two programs? R is the programming language, that takes our code and creates our graphs. RStudio is a program we use to edit and view our R files and plots; known as an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Install R\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can Install R from this website. You want to select the version for your operating system (Windows or Mac).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Install RStudio\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce R is installed, you can install RStudio from this website.\nThe free version is more than sufficient I don’t know anyone who has needed Desktop pro.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Create or move to a folder for LS4003\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce RStudio is open, you want to browse files until you can find your documents - wherever you keep your university files.\nNext, create a folder to keep all your R programming work in (e.g “LS4003 R Programming”).\nClick on the new folder to enter it. Click the cog, and “Set as Working Directory”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Create an R file\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you’re in your project you can create and save an R file. This is where you put your code.\n\nClick on the Green Plus icon and select “R Script”\nClick the Save icon\nGive your file a name (e.g. “My_R_file” )\n\nRemember to keep saving your file using the save icon.\n\n\n\nGIF of Making an R File\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will automatically add the “.R” extension so we know it’s an R file - My_R_file.R\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 5: Write and run R code\n\n\n\n\n\nYou’re now ready to run some R code!\n\nCopy and paste the following into your R file:\n\n\nvalue &lt;- \"Hello World\"\nvalue\n\n\nSave your R file by clicking the save icon\nHighlight both lines and click the “Run” icon (green arrow)\n\nYou should see a result in your console (bottom left panel) and your environment (top right panel)\nYou’re now ready to start learning R!"
