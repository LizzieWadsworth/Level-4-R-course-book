You need to install by typing install.packages('dplyr') if you haven’t already.\nWe’re using the filter() function to select all rows where treatmentTime is exactly 0. Be sure to notice the double ==!\n%&gt;% is a pipe - it’s telling R to pass the dataset on the left (locust_df) to the function on the right (filter())\nWe don’t want to overwrite our full dataset, so we’re saving in a new dataframe called treatment0_df using &lt;- .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteQuestion\n\n\n\nCan you create a dataset with only the treatmentTime values that are more than 0?",
