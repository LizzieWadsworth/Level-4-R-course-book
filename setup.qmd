# Set up

We are going to use RStudio for this course. You can do this on campus from a University Computer, online using a free Posit Cloud account that you can access from any web browser, or by downloading R and RStudio onto your own device. 

Click below to see the set up instructions for each:

Once you're in your folder you can create and save an R file. This is where you put your code.

1.  Click on the Green Plus icon and select "R Script"
2.  Click the Save icon
3.  Give your file a name (e.g. "R_class_1" )

_This will automatically add the ".R" extension so we know it's an R file - `R_class_1.R`_

::: {.callout-warning icon="false" collapse="false"}
Make sure you can find your file in file explorer. 
Always **back up your work** such as saving in OneDrive or emailing to yourself so that you don't lose your progress.

### Online Cloud

[Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/plans/free) is a **free** online browser version, allowing you to work from any device. 

:::{.callout-caution collapse="false" title="Caution" icon="true"}
You shouldn't need a paid account for this course. If you use up the compute hours then I suggest downloading RStudio and R onto your own device.

### Own Device

If you're working on your own laptop or computer it's also possible to download and run R and RStudio. These are both free, open-source programs. 

::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}
If you're working on a tablet, chromebook or your device is typically slow, I recommend looking at the Posit Online Cloud option instead
:::

Installing R and RStudio can be a bit fiddley - let the teaching team know if you'd like any support. 

Why two programs? R is the programming language, that takes our code and creates our graphs. RStudio is a program we use to edit and view our R files and plots; known as an _Integrated Development Environment (IDE)_.

::: {.callout-note collapse="false" title="Step 1: Install R" icon="false"}

You can [Install R from this website](https://www.stats.bris.ac.uk/R/). You want to select the version for your operating system (Windows or Mac).

::: {.callout-caution collapse="false" title="Step 2: Install RStudio" icon="false"}

Once R is installed, you can [install RStudio from this website](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/?sid=1). 

The **free version** is more than sufficient 
_I don't know anyone who has ever needed Desktop pro_.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="false" title="Step 3: Create or move to a folder for LS4003" icon="false"}

Once you've downloaded and installed R and RStudio, you can open RStudio and then browse files until you can find your documents - wherever you keep your university files. 

1.  Browse your files by clicking the `...` in the top right corner of the bottom right panel. 

2.  Create a folder to keep all your R programming work in (e.g "LS4003_R"). 

3.  Click on the new folder and click "Open"

4.  Click the cog, and "Set as Working Directory"
