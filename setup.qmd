# Set up

We are going to use RStudio for this course. You can do this on campus from a University Computer, online using a free Posit Cloud account that you can access from any web browser, or by downloading R and RStudio onto your own device. 

Click below to see the set up instructions for each:

:::: {.callout-caution collapse="false" title="Step 2: Navigate to your OneDrive folder" icon="false"}
1.  Copy and paste the following into the **Console** on the left, and press enter.

`setwd("O:/")`

2.  Click the "More" cog and select "Go To Working Directory"

You should now be in your OneDrive. You should be able to recognise the files and folders listed, from what you have saved here in your other classes.

::: {.callout-important collapse="false" title="If you get the error message 'cannot change working directory'"}
Occasionally there is an issue with how OneDrive is loaded on the University computer.

If you get the error message:

`Error in setwd("O:/") : cannot change working directory`

Then try the following. **Replace the underscores with your K number.**

`setwd("C:/Users/K______/")`

Click the "More" cog and select "Go To Working Directory"

Then find and click on the folder:

`OneDrive Kingston University`

Click the more cog and select `Set As Working Directory`

::: {.callout-tip collapse="false" title="Step 3: Create or move to a folder for LS4003" icon="false"}
If you don't already have a folder for LS4003 Statistics, then you can create one by clicking "New Folder" and entering a name.

If your new folder doesn't appear, click the refresh button (to the right of the more cog).

Then:

1.  Click into your new folder

2.  Click the More Cog and select "Set As Working Directory"

::::: {.callout-caution collapse="false" title="Step 4: Create an R file" icon="false"}
Once you're in your folder you can create and save an R file. This is where you put your code.

1.  Click on the Green Plus icon and select "R Script"
2.  In the top bar, click "File" and then "Save"
3.  Give your file a name (e.g. "R_tutorial_1" )

When you make any changes, you can save the file by going File -\> Save.

You can also save by holding down Control and S at the same time.

::: {.callout-note icon="false" collapse="false"}
This will automatically add the ".R" extension so we know it's an R file - `R_tutorial_1.R`
:::

::: {.callout-warning icon="false" collapse="false"}
Make sure you can find your file in file explorer. Always **back up your work** such as saving in OneDrive or emailing to yourself so that you don't lose your progress.

::: {.callout-note collapse="false" title="Step 5: Write and run R code" icon="false"}
You're now ready to run some R code!

1.  Copy and paste the following into your R file:

```{r}
#| eval: false
value <- "Hello World"
value
```

2.  Highlight both lines and click the "Run" icon (green arrow)

You should see a result in your console (bottom left panel) and your environment (top right panel)

You're now ready to start learning R!

### Online Cloud

[Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/plans/free) is a **free** online browser version, allowing you to work from any device. 

:::{.callout-caution collapse="false" title="Caution" icon="true"}
You shouldn't need a paid account for this course. If you use up the compute hours then I suggest downloading RStudio and R onto your own device.

To get set up, follow the instructions below: 

::: {.callout-note collapse="false" title="Step 1: Launch RStudio from AppsAnywhere" icon="false"}
1.  [Create a free account](https://posit.cloud/plans/free) and login
2.  Create Project -> RStudio
3.  Name your project (where it says "Untitled Project")

::::: {.callout-caution collapse="false" title="Step 2: Create an R file" icon="false"}
Once you're in your project you can create and save an R file. This is where you put your code.

1.  Click on the Green Plus icon and select "R Script"
2.  Click the Save icon
3.  Give your file a name (e.g. "My_R_file" )

Remember to keep saving your file using the save icon.

### Own Device

If you're working on your own laptop or computer it's also possible to download and run R and RStudio. These are both free, open-source programs. 

::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}
If you're working on a tablet, chromebook or your device is typically slow, I recommend looking at the Posit Online Cloud option instead
:::

Installing R and RStudio can be a bit fiddley - let the teaching team know if you'd like any support. 

Why two programs? R is the programming language, that takes our code and creates our graphs. RStudio is a program we use to edit and view our R files and plots; known as an _Integrated Development Environment (IDE)_.

::: {.callout-note collapse="false" title="Step 1: Install R" icon="false"}

You can [Install R from this website](https://www.stats.bris.ac.uk/R/). You want to select the version for your operating system (Windows or Mac). 

:::


::: {.callout-caution collapse="false" title="Step 2: Install RStudio" icon="false"}

Once R is installed, you can [install RStudio from this website](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/?sid=1). 

The free version is more than sufficient _I don't know anyone who has needed Desktop pro_. 
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="false" title="Step 3: Create or move to a folder for LS4003" icon="false"}

Once RStudio is open, you want to browse files until you can find your documents - wherever you keep your university files. 

Next, create a folder to keep all your R programming work in (e.g "LS4003 R Programming"). 

Click on the new folder to enter it. Click the cog, and "Set as Working Directory"
