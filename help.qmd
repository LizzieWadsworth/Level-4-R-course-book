Stuck? That's normal! Learning programming is like learning a language, it takes a lot of time and you don't start fluent. 

Email Lizzie for support L.Wadsworth@kingston.ac.uk; it can help to send a screenshot or your .R file - every error is unique so the more information you can provide the quicker we can figure out the issue. 

Find below a list of common error messages. This will be updated throughout the teaching block as you send me the error messages you are getting.
